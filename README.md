# Hi 👋 I'm Muaviya Imran  

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** from Lahore, Pakistan, with 2+ years of professional experience delivering **scalable, high-quality web applications**. My expertise lies in building performant **frontend interfaces** and reliable **backend systems**, combining creativity with problem-solving to craft solutions that align with business needs.  

I specialize in **React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, Golang, and Python**, with hands-on experience in **AI integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain)**, microservices, and modern deployment workflows. Having collaborated with **international teams and clients**, I thrive in cross-cultural, remote-first environments where communication and adaptability are key.  

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about **continuous learning, open-source contributions, and experimenting with emerging technologies**. Whether it’s optimizing application performance, integrating AI models, or improving user experiences, I enjoy solving complex challenges and delivering solutions that matter.
